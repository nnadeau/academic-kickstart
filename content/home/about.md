# Bio

Hi! I'm Nicholas Nadeau.

I'm a professional engineer (P.Eng.), member of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ), and an associate value specialist (AVS).
I've spent the last decade creating unique technologies for the biomedical, robotics, and additive manufacturing domains.

I'm currently the Engineering Manager at AON3D and a PhD candidate at École de technologie supérieure.
