Nicholas Nadeau is an executive and project director at [Halodi Robotics](https://www.halodi.com/), leading their expansion into North America with the mission of bringing safe and capable humanoid robotics to everyone.

He is a professional engineer (P.Eng.) and a member of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ).
Nicholas received his Ph.D. from [École de technologie supérieure](http://en.etsmtl.ca/Unites-de-recherche/CoRo/Accueil?lang=en-CA) where his research combined [machine learning]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2018-evolutionary" >}}) and [collaborative robotics]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2019-impedance" >}}) to develop methods for [safe robotic freehand medical ultrasound]({{< ref "publication/nadeau-2019-towards" >}}).

Nicholas has spent the last decade creating unique technologies for the [biomedical](https://www.rogue-research.com/), [food robotics](https://www.ypc-technologies.com/), [collaborative robotics](https://www.halodi.com/), and [additive manufacturing](https://www.aon3d.com/) domains.
