Hi! 
I'm Nicholas Nadeau.

I'm currently the head of engineering at AON3D where I lead design, development, and R&D in both software and hardware to drive product innovation.
I am a professional engineer (P.Eng.), member of the Ordre des ingénieurs du Québec (OIQ), and an associate value specialist (AVS).
I have spent the last decade creating unique technologies for the biomedical, cognitive neuroscience, robotics, and additive manufacturing domains.
