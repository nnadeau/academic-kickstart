Sustainable mobility was the primary topic of the event. Overall, one of my favourite quotes came from [Bertrand Piccard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Piccard):

> We have to prove that protection of the environment is profitable.

I really enjoy the economic spin that this perspective provides. As shown by [Britainâ€™s famous Nudge Unit](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/big-returns-thinking-small/), behavioural tricks and incentives can be used for better government policy and social interaction. Nudging the private sector is just an extension of this concept.
