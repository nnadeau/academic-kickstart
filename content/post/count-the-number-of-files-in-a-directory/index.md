```bash
ls -l | wc -l
```
- `ls`: list directory contents
    - `-l`: list in long format
- `wc`: word, line, character, and byte count
    - `-l`: the number of lines is written to the standard output

This command counts the number of listed lines.
I find this most useful when I want to quickly see how many logs or records have been generated by a process.
