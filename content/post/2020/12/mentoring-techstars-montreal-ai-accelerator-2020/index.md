This past September, I had the chance to meet ten exciting AI startups part of [Techstars Montréal AI Accelerator](https://demoday.techstars.com/montreal-ai-2020-t5).
The program prides itself on being founder-first and mentor-driven, and I’m proud to say that I am one of those mentors.

The big finale of the accelerator program is Demo Day, where the public and investors have the opportunity to meet the startups, engage with founders, and network with the leaders of the dynamic Montréal tech ecosystem.

## Bridgr and Being a Lead Mentoring

I also take pride in the fact that I was a [lead mentor](https://www.techstars.com/the-line/advice/mentor-manifesto) for [Bridgr](https://bridgr.co/), an algorithmic advisory practice that guides industrial companies through their digital journey.
The cofounders [Amira Boutouchent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amiraboutouchent/) and [Mehdi Drissi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdrissi/) are ambitious and savvy: they're targeting a multibillion dollar industry that's in need of disruption.

With my background in collaborative robotics, I've seen companies struggle to understand the effort needed to achieve Industry 4.0 goals.
Through our biweekly one-on-ones, I had the opportunity to watch the team grow and develop a product that resonated with an entire industry.

With companies like Bridgr, the industrial world can become more agile, efficient, and effective.
