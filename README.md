Personal website, portfolio, and blog.

## Development

### Run Server

```
hugo server
```

### New Post/Talk/Etc

```
hugo new post/my-post-title.md

hugo new talk/my-talk-title.md
```

### Test Branches

- Use the `test` git branch

## Notes

- YouTube embeds work better as an iFrame instead of Hugo shortcode
- Use `<!--more-->` in posts to limit summary
- Blank post summaries with `summary = " "`
